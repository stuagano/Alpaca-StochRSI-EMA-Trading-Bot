## Next Steps

### To Use Ref MCP Tools

**IMPORTANT**: You may need to restart Claude Code for the ref tools to become fully available.

Once available, you'll have access to:

1. **ref_search_documentation** - AI-powered documentation search
   ```javascript
   ref_search_documentation("Alpaca Trading API authentication setup")
   ```

2. **ref_read_url** - Fetch and convert webpages to markdown
   ```javascript
   ref_read_url("https://alpaca.markets/docs/")
   ```

### Setting Up API Key (Optional but Recommended)

For better performance, you can add your ref.tools API key:

1. Get API key from [ref.tools](https://ref.tools)
2. Edit your Claude Code MCP configuration to include the API key:
   ```bash
   claude mcp config ref
   ```
   Then add environment variable:
   ```json
   {
     "ref": {
       "command": "npx",
       "args": ["ref-tools-mcp@latest"],
       "env": {
         "REF_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Benefits

- **Token Efficiency**: Reduces documentation fetching from 15k+ to 5k tokens
- **Cost Savings**: ~58% reduction in token costs
- **Smart Filtering**: Returns only relevant documentation sections
- **Session Awareness**: Avoids duplicate results

## Testing Commands

After restarting Claude Code, test with:

```bash
# Search for Alpaca documentation
ref_search_documentation("Alpaca API place market order documentation")

# Read specific documentation page
ref_read_url("https://alpaca.markets/docs/api-references/trading-api/orders/")

# Search for TradingView charts setup
ref_search_documentation("TradingView Lightweight Charts initialization")
```
