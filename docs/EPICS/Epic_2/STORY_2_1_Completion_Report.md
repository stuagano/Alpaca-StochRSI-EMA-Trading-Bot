## Summary of Work Done

*   **Backend:**
    *   Modified the `/api/chart_indicators/<symbol>` endpoint in `flask_app.py` to calculate and return the fast and slow EMA lines for the MA Crossover strategy, as well as the StochRSI bands.
    *   Updated the `calculate_indicators_series` method in `services/unified_data_manager.py` to include these calculations.
*   **Frontend:**
    *   Added UI controls (checkboxes) to the `templates/unified_dashboard.html` file to allow users to toggle the visibility of the MA Crossover and StochRSI indicators.
    *   Modified the JavaScript to fetch the indicator data from the backend and render the indicators on the chart using the Lightweight Charts library.
    *   Ensured that the indicators update automatically when the symbol or timeframe is changed.

All acceptance criteria have been met, and the feature is fully functional.
