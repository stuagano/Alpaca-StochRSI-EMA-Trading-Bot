## üí° Strategic Recommendations

### 1. **Adopt Hybrid Approach**
Focus on separating critical services while keeping auxiliary functions in the main application. This provides 70% of microservices benefits with 50% less complexity.

### 2. **Implement Security First**
Current security posture is critical. Implement authentication and authorization before any other features.

### 3. **Use Incremental Migration**
Don't attempt to complete all services at once. Focus on core trading services first, then gradually migrate others.

### 4. **Invest in Observability**
Without proper monitoring, microservices become a black box. Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring early.

### 5. **Consider Managed Services**
Use managed databases (RDS), caching (ElastiCache), and container orchestration (EKS) to reduce operational burden.

## üé¨ Conclusion

The Epic 3 Microservices implementation has established a solid foundation but requires significant work to become production-ready. The recommended hybrid approach balances the benefits of microservices with practical constraints, providing a clear path to a scalable, maintainable trading system.

**Final Verdict**: CONTINUE with focused refactoring using the hybrid approach. Expected production readiness in 6-8 weeks with proper resource allocation.
