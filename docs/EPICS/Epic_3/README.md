# Epic 3: Microservices Architecture

## Status: ⚠️ PARTIAL (40% Complete)

### Overview
Epic 3 aimed to transform the monolithic trading system into a distributed microservices architecture. Foundation established but not production-ready.

### What Was Built (40%)
- ✅ 5 core services with FastAPI
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ✅ Health check endpoints
- ✅ Basic API Gateway
- ✅ Service templates

### Services Created
1. **API Gateway** (Port 8000)
2. **Position Management** (Port 8001)
3. **Trading Execution** (Port 8002)
4. **Signal Processing** (Port 8003)
5. **Risk Management** (Port 8004)

### Documentation
- [Completion Report](./EPIC_3_COMPLETION_REPORT.md) - 40% status
- [Architecture Plan](./EPIC_3_MICROSERVICES_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Fault Tolerance Design](./EPIC_3_FAULT_TOLERANCE.md)

### What's Missing (60%)
- ❌ Real trading integration
- ❌ Database connections
- ❌ Inter-service communication
- ❌ 7 additional planned services
- ❌ Production features

### Path to Completion
1. **Week 1**: Connect real data
2. **Week 2**: Service communication
3. **Week 3**: Complete remaining services
4. **Week 4**: Production features

### Recommendation
**Hybrid Approach**: Separate only critical services (Trading, Risk, Data) while keeping simpler components in monolith. This provides microservices benefits without full complexity.

### Investment Required
- **Development**: 3-4 weeks
- **Testing**: 1 week
- **Documentation**: 3 days
- **ROI**: Positive for scaling needs
