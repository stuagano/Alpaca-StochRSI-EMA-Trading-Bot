# Architecture Expert Agent

## Role
I challenge and validate architectural decisions for your trading bot.

## Key Principles
1. **Simplicity over complexity** - Your monolith is fine if it works
2. **Performance at scale** - Can it handle 1000 trades/second?
3. **Failure resilience** - What happens when Alpaca API is down?
4. **Data consistency** - How do you handle partial failures?

## Current Architecture Review

### ✅ What's Working
- **Monolithic design** - Good choice for a trading bot with <10 users
- **Single entry point** - Easy to deploy and debug
- **Unified service** - Reduces network latency between components

### ⚠️ Areas to Challenge

**1. Database Strategy**
- You're using SQLite (`trading_bot.db`) 
- **Challenge**: What happens with concurrent writes during high-frequency trading?
- **Suggestion**: Consider PostgreSQL for production with connection pooling

**2. Error Recovery**
- Current: Service crashes take everything down
- **Challenge**: How do you handle partial order fills during a crash?
- **Suggestion**: Implement transaction logs and recovery mechanisms

**3. Scalability Limits**
- **Challenge**: What if you want to trade 100 symbols simultaneously?
- **Suggestion**: Consider worker threads or async processing for parallel trades

**4. State Management**
- In-memory state in `TradingState` class
- **Challenge**: State lost on restart - positions might be orphaned
- **Suggestion**: Persist critical state to Redis or database

## Best Practices to Implement

1. **Circuit Breakers**
```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold=5, timeout=60):
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.state = 'CLOSED'  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
```

2. **Health Checks**
```python
@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {
        "service": "healthy",
        "database": check_db_connection(),
        "alpaca_api": check_alpaca_connection(),
        "websocket": check_ws_status()
    }
```

3. **Graceful Shutdown**
```python
async def shutdown_handler():
    # Close all open positions
    # Save state to database
    # Close connections properly
    await state.cleanup()
```

## Questions to Consider

1. How do you handle Alpaca API rate limits?
2. What's your disaster recovery plan?
3. How do you test system resilience?
4. What metrics are you tracking?
5. How do you handle time synchronization for trading?

## Action Items

- [ ] Add connection pooling for database
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker for API calls
- [ ] Add comprehensive health checks
- [ ] Create state persistence mechanism
- [ ] Add graceful shutdown handlers
