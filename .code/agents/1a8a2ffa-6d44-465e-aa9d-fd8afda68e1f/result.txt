## ðŸŽ‰ Summary of Changes

All deliverables have been successfully completed! Here's what was accomplished:

### 1. **Flask Static Configuration** âœ…
- Updated `backend/api/__init__.py` to configure Flask with:
  - `static_folder` = `frontend/` directory
  - `static_url_path` = `/` for clean URLs
- Static assets now served directly by Flask at root paths

### 2. **Dashboard Blueprint Refactoring** âœ…
- Updated `backend/api/blueprints/dashboard.py`:
  - Replaced `send_from_directory` with `app.send_static_file()`
  - Removed legacy `/frontend/<path:filename>` route
  - Proper mapping: `/simple` â†’ `index.html`, `/advanced` â†’ `crypto-dashboard.html`

### 3. **Frontend Configuration** âœ…
- `frontend/config.js` uses `window.location.origin` (preserves port automatically)
- Updated `frontend/dashboard.html` to:
  - Load `/config.js` before `/script.js`
  - Use API_CONFIG if available, with fallbacks
  - Updated API calls to use configured endpoints
- Updated `frontend/index.html` to load config properly

### 4. **Single-Command Launcher** âœ…
- Created `run_dashboard.sh` script with:
  - Python/venv checks
  - Dependency installation
  - Colorful output
  - Port configuration via `FLASK_PORT` env var
- Created `Makefile` with `make dashboard` target
- Updated `DASHBOARD-QUICKSTART.md` with new instructions

### 5. **Graceful Alpaca Handling** âœ…
- Modified `backend/api/services/__init__.py` to handle missing/invalid Alpaca credentials
- Server runs without Alpaca API (with warnings)
- Dashboard loads successfully even without trading features

### 6. **Verification Results** âœ…
```bash
# Static assets serving (200 OK):
GET /config.js     âœ“ 200 OK
GET /script.js     âœ“ 200 OK  
GET /style.css     âœ“ 200 OK

# Dashboard pages (200 OK):
GET /              âœ“ 200 OK (dashboard.html)
GET /simple        âœ“ 200 OK (index.html)

# API endpoint:
GET /api/v1/status âœ“ 200 OK {"status":"running",...}
```

Server successfully started on port 5010 with all static assets served correctly!

### Quick Start Commands:
```bash
# Single command launch:
./run_dashboard.sh

# Or with Make:
make dashboard

# Custom port:
FLASK_PORT=5010 ./run_dashboard.sh
```

The dashboard is now fully wired with:
- Clean static asset URLs (no more 404s)
- Proper config loading order
- Single-command startup
- Port flexibility
- Graceful degradation without Alpaca credentials
