Excellent! The Flask app is working correctly and the `/api/v1/status` endpoint returns a proper response. The `init_services` function is now fully restored and functional.

## Summary

I've successfully restored the `backend/api/services/__init__.py` file with:

1. **Complete `init_services` function** that:
   - Loads Alpaca credentials using `utils.alpaca.load_alpaca_credentials`
   - Initializes AlpacaClient, TradingService, and PnLService
   - Registers services with ServiceRegistry if available
   - Handles missing configuration gracefully
   - Provides fallback services on initialization errors

2. **Fallback class definitions** for when real implementations are missing:
   - Each class logs warnings when using fallback versions
   - All classes have basic stub methods that return appropriate empty values

3. **Proper exports** via `__all__` including:
   - `init_services`
   - `TradingService`
   - `PnLService`
   - `AlpacaClient`

4. **Helper function** `_sqlite_path_from_url` for database path extraction

The Flask application now starts successfully with all services properly initialized, as confirmed by:
- The Flask app creates without errors
- The `/api/v1/status` endpoint responds correctly
- Services are registered with the ServiceRegistry
- Graceful fallback handling when dependencies are missing
