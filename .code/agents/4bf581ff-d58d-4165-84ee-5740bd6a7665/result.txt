Prompt:
Investigate and propose fixes for the Flask dashboard/frontend bugs in this repo. Current behaviour:
- Running `python backend/api/run.py --host localhost --port 5001 --debug` serves `frontend/dashboard.html` for `/`, but the `/simple` and `/advanced` routes return 404 JSON because `backend/api/blueprints/dashboard.py` tries to serve `simple.html` and `advanced.html` that are absent from `frontend/` (the existing HTML files are `index.html` and `crypto-dashboard.html`).
- Several REST endpoints backing the dashboard throw 500s. For example, `/api/v1/symbols` raises `'Config' object has no attribute 'TRADING_CONFIG'` because the blueprints access `current_app.config.TRADING_CONFIG` instead of the dict-style key. Similar attribute access exists in `backend/api/blueprints/trading.py` and may break other buttons in the UI.
- The dashboard JavaScript lives in `frontend/script.js` and drives the UI via endpoints defined in `frontend/config.js`. Make sure the JS still works after fixes.
Desired outcome: align the Flask blueprint routes and config usage so that the dashboard loads without missing-file errors, API responses are 200s, and the front-end JS can fetch account/positions/signals successfully. Feel free to suggest any necessary tweaks to the HTML/JS if they rely on the buggy endpoints.
Key files to inspect: `backend/api/blueprints/dashboard.py`, `backend/api/blueprints/api.py`, `backend/api/blueprints/trading.py`, `frontend/config.js`, `frontend/dashboard.html`.
Deliverables: summary of diagnosed issues and concrete patch suggestions (Flask + frontend) to remove the runtime errors.

Desired output: Patch recommendations fixing the Flask frontend runtime errors

Assistant Messages:
1. **Summary**
* The dashboard blueprint still routes `/simple` and `/advanced` to `simple.html`/`advanced.html`, but only `dashboard.html`, `index.html`, and `crypto-dashboard.html` exist in the frontend, so those endpoints currently 404.

2. * Several API handlers dereference `current_app.config.TRADING_CONFIG` as if it were an attribute-bearing object (`config.trading.symbols`, `.mode`), even though Flask stores the config under the `'TRADING_CONFIG'` key and the unified config is already the trading dataclass. This causes attribute errors and breaks signal/symbol responses.

3. * The trading blueprint has the same config misuse and additionally calls `.dict()` on a dataclass and blindly accesses `request.get_json().get(...)`, which raises when no payload is posted to `/stop` or `/strategy` GET.

4. * The legacy `frontend/script.js` still hardcodes un-versioned `/api/...` paths (including a nonexistent `/api/trades`) instead of the v1 routes defined in `frontend/config.js`, so loading `index.html` immediately hits 404s.

5. **Recommended Fixes**
* Replace the hardcoded template names in `dashboard.py` with a single dictionary that maps logical route names (`'/'`, `'simple'`, `'advanced'`) to the actual files (`dashboard.html`, `index.html`, `crypto-dashboard.html`). Serve through that map (e.g., `template = DASHBOARD_TEMPLATES.get(view, 'dashboard.html')`) so new variants can be added in one place and the DRY principle is preserved.

6. * In both `api.py` and `trading.py`, grab the unified config once via `config = current_app.config['TRADING_CONFIG']` and then use its real attributes (`config.symbols`, `config.market_type`, `asdict(config.indicators)`). This removes the attribute errors and keeps consumption consistent with `init_services`, which already treats the config as the dataclass. Update any responses that expect a `mode` string to return `config.market_type` (or another centrally defined field) and share constants if multiple modules need them.

7. * Harden the trading control endpoints by reading `data = request.get_json(silent=True) or {}` before looking up keys (e.g., `close_positions = data.get('close_positions', False)`), and import `asdict` for serializing dataclasses without adding ad-hoc helpers.

8. * Update `frontend/script.js` to consume the routes exposed in `config.js` (e.g., `buildApiUrl('status')`) instead of hardcoded `/api/...` strings, and swap the missing `/api/trades` call for `buildApiUrl('pnlTrades')` (or whatever endpoint is exposed under `/api/v1/pnl/trades`). Load `config.js` ahead of `script.js` to keep endpoint definitions centralized and avoid future drift.

9. * After applying the backend fixes, verify the UI buttons that hit trading/status/symbols endpoints work end-to-end. Because these handlers surface live config values, consider adding regression tests (e.g., Flask test client) to assert 200 responses and expected payload shapes so future config refactors don’t reintroduce attribute errors.

**Testing**
* Not run (investigation only).

10. I'm exploring AGENTS.md for patch recommendations since I'm in read-only mode.

11. I'm checking the root directory for any relevant files.

12. Hmm, the command didn't run. Maybe it needs a newline or simply more time?

13. Time to check for any AGENTS.md file to guide next steps.

14. I'll track down the AGENTS.md to check for relevant instructions.

15. I'll look for AGENTS.md in the backend/api directory and possibly frontend.

16. I need to check the files that are relevant to the top instructions.

17. It looks like the simple/advanced routes are pointing to non-existent HTML files. Time to inspect the frontend directory for proper mappings!

18. I need to confirm the correct config access syntax and check if TRADING_CONFIG is a dict.

19. I'm searching for the trading blueprint file now.

20. I need to check the config class to understand the key style used.

21. I need to check the app creation file to clarify the config structure.

22. I'll take a look at the run file to confirm everything is set up correctly.

23. I just realized that I need to add an __init__ method for initialization.

24. I need to fetch the rest of the file to finish reviewing.

25. The config is a dict, not an object. I need to check blueprint usage and endpoints.

26. I’ll take a look at the frontend/dashboard.html file.

27. I need to outline issues, then suggest modifications, like fixing HTML naming or restructuring routes.

28. It seems like "crypto-dashboard.html" could be more advanced than expected. I'll investigate.

29. I'll check the attribute access for those 500 errors and review how config is used.

30. I'm updating the blueprint to use `current_app.config['TRADING_CONFIG']` and adjusting Pydantic usage. Need to ensure `stop_trading` handles `None` from `get_json()`. Will apply safe handling there.

31. No config issues—I'll focus on aligning REST endpoints with the frontend, checking TRADING usage. Would be good to confirm config across `services` modules. I'll suggest tweaks, like aligning routes with existing HTML—maybe use `send_from_directory` for static files. For `dashboard.html`, I'd map it properly. Also, considering a mapping dictionary to keep things DRY and manage config paths—perhaps unify them to avoid duplication, but need to validate potential 500s and inspect `unified_config.py`.

32. Looking for the 'trading' property inside the `UnifiedConfig` dataclass.

33. I see `TradingConfig` nests attributes like `indicators`. I'll review `UnifiedConfig` for final structure.

34. I think TradingConfig could be the root, no need for a nested `config.trading`.

35. I see that `TRADING_CONFIG` is a `TradingConfig` dataclass. So, referencing `config.trading` is wrong; I should directly use `config.symbols`. The blueprint needs adjustments too: it calls `config.TRADING_CONFIG.trading.symbols`, which would fail. I’ll update it to `config.symbols` since `TradingConfig` has that attribute. Additionally, `strategy_config` should be referenced as `config.strategy`, not `config.trading.strategy`. 

I also found a crucial bug involving `IndicatorsConfig`. It doesn’t have a `dict()` method, and I need `dataclasses.asdict` to properly convert it. I'll need to fix this error for it to work.

Lastly, I'll verify that `frontend/script.js` aligns with the data formats. Time to check the script now!

36. The script uses old endpoints, but `config.js` has the updated ones. I'll check `dashboard.html`.

37. I should scroll to the bottom of the file to see more details.

38. I need to check the bottom of `index.html` to see if it uses `script.js`.

39. I see issues in alignment between front & back; need patch recommendations, especially on `dashboard.py`.

40. Looks like `mode` is missing, should map to `config.market_type`. Signals fallback needs fixing too. I'll check the trading.py file for other issues. Also, for strategy config, `GET` should return `config.strategy`. I'll inspect and confirm any errors while keeping it read-only.

41. I need to use `nl -ba` to get accurate line numbers from `dashboard.py` for citations.

42. I should gather the line numbers for `api.py` and check `frontend` if needed.

43. I need to gather the line numbers for the issues, including in `trading.py`.

44. I need to remove `request.get_json().get` causing the attribute error and check `config.js`.

45. I need to highlight that `dashboard.html` uses inline endpoints, but `script.js` uses the old ones. I'll focus on citing actual lines from `frontend/dashboard.html` and `frontend/index.html` to show which files exist (like `dashboard.html`, `index.html`, and `crypto`). To demonstrate missing files like `simple.html`, I'll refer to the `frontend` directory.

46. I need to reference `frontend/crypto-dashboard.html` for the advanced view component.

47. I need to reference `frontend/script.js` to demonstrate hitting unversioned endpoints.

48. I'll propose a plan for config centralization and cleaner route-to-template mapping for DRY.

49. I'll make sure the functions rely on versioned endpoints.

50. I'm focusing on integrating a new config.js to avoid duplicating endpoints in `script.js`. I’ll propose fixes for the missing `/api/trades` route, a 404 issue. I'll suggest handling mapping with a dictionary to prevent repetition of `send_from_directory`. Also, referencing `current_app.config.get('TRADING_CONFIG')` should avoid attribute errors.

I'll organize the summary with a brief list of diagnosed issues and concrete patch suggestions as needed.

I'll search the trading blueprint to see if the route is defined there.

51. The front-end script uses outdated `/api/trades` instead of the updated `/api/v1/pnl/trades`. I need to suggest updating that and aligning the configuration. The `index.html` should load both `config.js` and `script.js` to use versioned endpoints, but currently, only the latter is loaded. I'll propose restructuring `script.js` to use `API_CONFIG`. 

I'll prepare a patch with detailed suggestions for both backend and frontend fixes.

I’ll suggest updating routes, centralizing mapping, and refactoring `script.js` to import `config.js`. I'll also recommend fetching the correct routes, using `silent=True` for JSON, and adjusting the environment settings. Since no code changes were made, I’ll note no tests were run.

Final message will include summary, fixes, and mention of no tests.
