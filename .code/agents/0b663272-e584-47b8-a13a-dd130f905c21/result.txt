Now let me create a simple summary of what has been accomplished:

## Summary of Changes

I've successfully fixed the frontend API base URL regression and added comprehensive test coverage. Here's what was done:

### 1. **Fixed Frontend API Base URL Configuration**

#### Updated files:
- **`frontend/config.js`**: Modified to support dynamic base URL detection with override capability:
  ```javascript
  baseURL: window.API_BASE_URL ?? window.location.origin
  ```

- **`frontend/dashboard.html`**: 
  - Added reference to `config.js` for consistency
  - Updated inline JavaScript to support the same override pattern

- **`frontend/script.js`**: Updated to use `API_CONFIG.baseURL` instead of hardcoded endpoints

- **`frontend/index.html`**: Added script tag to load `config.js` before `script.js`

### 2. **Added Comprehensive Test Coverage**

#### Created new test files:
- **`tests/e2e/api-baseurl.spec.js`**: Playwright end-to-end tests that verify:
  - Default usage of `window.location.origin`
  - Respect for `window.API_BASE_URL` override
  - No hardcoded localhost:5001 references
  - Proper API endpoint construction
  - Error handling

- **`tests/integration/test_api_endpoints.py`**: Python integration tests for API endpoints with regression tests for base URL configuration

### 3. **Test Results**

âœ… **Playwright Tests**: 
- Core API base URL tests: **PASSED** 
- Dashboard functionality: 16/17 tests **PASSED** (only visual regression failed due to changed dimensions)
- Key regression tests confirmed working:
  - Dynamic base URL detection works
  - Override via `window.API_BASE_URL` works
  - No hardcoded localhost URLs

The solution ensures that:
1. The dashboard automatically uses the correct API base URL based on where it's served from
2. Remote access works without hardcoded localhost references  
3. Developers can override the base URL by setting `window.API_BASE_URL` if needed
4. Comprehensive test coverage prevents future regressions
