Fix the frontend API base URL regression and add automated coverage.

Context:
- Repository: Alpaca-StochRSI-EMA-Trading-Bot
- Key file: frontend/config.js currently defaults `API_CONFIG.baseURL` to `'http://localhost:5001'`. This breaks remote dashboard access; previously it used `window.location.origin` with override via `window.API_BASE_URL`.
- Goal: restore safe autodetection (`window.API_BASE_URL ?? window.location.origin`) while still allowing override if defined.
- Update any dependent frontend code (e.g., script.js) if needed to keep using `buildApiUrl` consistently.
- Add automated coverage: ensure frontend smoke tests (Playwright) or API integration tests detect wrong data shape/base URL issues. There is an existing Playwright setup (`npm test`) and Python integration tests in `tests/integration/test_api_endpoints.py`. Introduce a regression test that fails if baseURL is hard-coded.
- Ensure all tests pass: `pytest -q` and `npm test` (or targeted Playwright test) in repo root.

Deliverables:
1. Updated `frontend/config.js` (and related frontend files if necessary) with dynamic base URL handling and documented override pattern.
2. Regression test(s) proving the dashboard loads data with mocked API base override or using window origin (choose reliable approach).
3. Test run logs showing Python + Playwright tests succeeding.

Please explore the repo as needed, make the code changes, run the required tests, and report back with modifications and results.

**Identifying read-only environment constraints**
[2025-10-15T20:43:39] codex

I’m blocked from making changes—the workspace is mounted read-only, and with approvals disabled I can’t edit files or run tests. If you can re-enable write access (or supply updated files), I’ll pick up the fix and regression test right away.
